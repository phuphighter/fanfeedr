There was usually a very wide margin between the two, always in favor of the pitcher.*\\n\\nThe \\\"ace\\\" pitcher faced an average of 136 hitters in the postseason (they ranged from Greg Maddux to Andy Pettitte to Josh Beckett to Chris Carpenter). The most used (usually leadoff) hitter had an average of 70 PA/postseason, just about half as many opportunities to help his team as the pitcher.**\\n\\nSo it's pretty obvious that a single pitcher does, in fact, play a bigger role in the playoffs than a single hitter.\\n\\nBut what if we include a hitter's defense?\\n\\nGoing by regular season stats, there have been 37-38 defensive chances per game over the last 17 years. Dividing that by nine fielders equals about four chances per player per game. (Obviously this number can vary based on position: While catchers, first- and second-basemen have the most chances, pitchers have the fewest; but it's just an average, so bear with me.) If we add four \\\"opportunities\\\" to each hitter through each playoff game, where does that put them?\\n\\nIt makes it much closer. It gives hitters an extra 60 opportunities (on average) to help their team in the postseason. That brings a position player's total to 130, only six shy of pitchers' opportunities. Throw in a few stolen bases and it's nearly even.\\n\\nBut... pitchers also contribute on defense (not a lot), about two chances per game. But they only appear every few days or so, so it wouldn't add all that much to their totals.\\n\\nIn the end, it appears that a single pitcher can (and usually does) contribute more during the playoffs (what with extra off days and less worry about late-season health) than a single position player. That, of course, doesn't mean he will (the ace pitcher could suck), but he does have more opportunities to do so.\\n\\nExamples: In the 1999 playoffs, Orlando Hernandez faced 117 batters and Derek Jeter had 53 PA. Toss in about four plays/game for Jeter on defense (over 12 games) and he gets credit for 101 opportunities, still less than El Duque though. This past October, however, while Chris Carpenter faced 148 batters over St. Louis' 18 postseason games, Rafael Furcal had 81 PA and approximately 72 chances on defense, for a total of 153, slightly higher than the pitcher. But this was the exception, not the rule.***\\n\\nPerhaps Brian Cashman was thinking along the same lines when he traded Jesus Montero for Michael Pineda . Since Montero might have been nothing more than a DH with the Yankees (and would therefore receive zero defensive credit), the fact that Cashman traded him for a (potentially great) starting pitcher makes sense.\\n\\n* All I cared about was who had more opportunities to help his club, not whether he did or not.\\n\\n** Instead of choosing one hitter, I sometimes chose a combination of hitters that had the most PA in each playoff series (LDS, LCS and WS), so while in some years that was one player, other years it was three. For example, Tim Raines led the Yankees in PA in the '96 LDS, but Derek Jeter had more in the LCS and it was Bernie Williams in the WS. In '98 though, Paul O'Neill led the club in every series. If anything, this gives slightly more credit to the hitters than they deserve.\\n\\n*** Go back to the days of four-man rotations and the \\\"ace\\\" pitcher gets an even bigger advantage.\\n\\n[Source: The indomitable BRef .

Photo by Brule Laker Dallas McPherson signed a minor-league contract with the White Sox today. In his honor, then, and because failed prospects fascinate me, here are 20 facts 1 about Dallas McPherson. In 2005-2006, McPherson hit .250/.296/.459 for the Angels in 341 plate appearances as a 24-25-year-old. This was more or less, accounting for park, a league-average performance overall, despite being quite light on avoiding making outs. McPherson is listed at 6'4\\\" and 230, or 1.05 x A.J. Pierzynski. McPherson attempted six steals in 2005 despite getting on base like ten times and further despite being 1.05 x A.J. Pierzynski in size. McPherson attended The Citadel. Because McPherson attended The Citadel, his teammates and coaches are required to address him at all times as \\\"Lieutenant McPherson\\\" or \\\"sir\\\" or \\\"Ell Tee.\\\" McPherson's injury history on Baseball Prospectus reads like Lindsay Lohan's rap-sheet. The reason for this is because McPherson is a criminal. The real reason is because he has a back problem. In 2009, during training camp, McPherson strained his trunk. Nobody uses trunks anymore. It's all wheely suitcases and backpacks. Lame. Dallas McPherson was rated by Baseball America as the #12 prospect in all of baseball before 2005 after he spent 2003-2004 completely destroying the baseball, putting up full-year slugging percentages of .596 and .670. In retrospect, those 169 strikeouts in 586 plate appearances at AA and AAA are pretty alarming. Also in retrospect, Salt Lake was an insane place to hit. Adam Riggs slugged .633 in a full season there in 2004. I've never heard of Adam Riggs. Neither have you. Dallas McPherson pitched at The Citadel and is in their Hall of Fame despite having shot many many fewer people than Old Hoss Radbourn. McPherson has only shot three people. If you'd been to Rancho Cucamonga in 2003, you'd know why. Dallas McPherson, if he plays what he calls a full season (80-110 games), will crack 800 minor-league games, 3000 minor-league at-bats, 200 minor-league doubles, 200 minor-league homers, 900 minor-league hits, 700 minor-league RBI. Bonus fact: I will be rooting for McPherson to hit all these milestones (ok, \\\"milestones\\\") and more this year. Neither I nor any other T.P.A. writer stands by these facts as true and factual. Rely on them at your risk. 2 &#160; &#8617; Some of these facts are actually true. Many of them, in fact.

They also said that Brandon will be making a yearly donation to the Jays Care Foundation. They have a press conference coming at 10:30 Eastern to talk about the signing, but I'm a little too far away.\\n\\nOmar Vizquel : They also announced that Omar Vizquel has signed a minor league contract, with a spring training invite.

None of these guys should individually be expected to have any impact, but it is quite likely one or two of them will stick and play a role at some point during the season. The obvious soft spots on the 25-man roster heading into camp is the role of situational right-handed bat that can play OF and/or 1B. The Indians well-honed emphasis on flexibility and depth means that the bullpen, despite being very good last year and returning essentially the same cast this season, could house one or two NRIs at the end of the Spring. Here is a roundup of the Indians off-season minor league signings to date and an appraisal of what impact they might have.\\n\\nMatt Pagnozzi C (12/02/11) - Pagnozzi is likely AAA depth at catcher, competing with last year's minor league free agent acquisition Michel Hernandez for the backup spot behind Luke Carlin. Pagnozzi has actually seen action in the majors each of the past three seasons - for Pittsburgh, Colorado and St. Louis - but only a handful of games in each of those appearances. The Indians only have two catchers on the 40-man roster (Santana and Marson), so anyone playing the position at Columbus has the chance to make an appearance in Cleveland in the case of injury. Presumably Pagnozzi has some acumen manning the position and working with pitchers, because his offensive abilities (high Ks, low BBs, poor power and hit tools) are lacking.\\n\\nJose Lopez 2B (12/16/11) - Lopez is arguably the most decorated off-season NRI, having been selected to the All-Star game in 2006 while playing for Seattle (he was, it should be noted, a fairly poor choice). Prior to that, his performance at a young age in the upper minors made him a two-time Baseball America top 100 prospect (2003 #38, 2004 #70). Lopez, although not particularly old at just 28, is well past his peak years in Seattle. At his best, Lopez was an adequate to plus fielder at 2B with above average power for the position that made up for a lack of on-base ability. The past two seasons, Lopez has simply been bad (.233/.263/.348 for Seattle, Colorado and Florida). As a right-handed hitter potentially capable of playing any of the infield spots, Lopez seemingly duplicates the flexibility of Jason Donald. Lopez is almost assuredly behind Donald in the pecking order, however, who is himself behind starters Cabrera/Kipnis and in competition with Cord Phelps and Jack Hannahan , both who are already on the roster. If he accepts it, Lopez could be the utility man in Columbus.\\n\\nFelix Pie OF (12/16/11) - Pie brings the excitement that comes with being a \\\"failed, former big-time prospect.\\\" Pie was a 5-time Baseball America top 100 prospect, ranking somewhere between #27 and #85 every season between 2003 and 2007. Perhaps because of questionable usage by the Cubs early in his career, and certainly because of a twisted (click the link) and frequent injury history, Pie has never turned his raw tools and athleticism into steady baseball performance. His best season at the major league level was 2009 in Baltimore, when he played 101 games, mainly split between CF and LF, with an OPS of .763. Pie will turn 27 next month, but given his poor development and injury history, it feels like an old 27. If he were healthy, and if the Indians were able to make significant progress in consolidating his raw tools, maybe you could imagine him competing for a backup OF spot on the roster. That seems unlikely though, and a spot in Columbus' outfield, if he accepts, seems far more likely.\\n\\nAndy LaRoche 3B (12/21/11) - Another failed top prospect, LaRoche has never been able to reproduce the above average power and plate approach that made him a top prospect in the Dodger's system back in the mid-2000s. LaRoche, a four-time BA top 100 prospect, reached as high as #19 on the list following a 2007 season at AAA Las Vegas that saw him hit .309/.399/.589. Keep in mind that the PCL is a notoriously high-offense league when looking at those numbers. In the majors, LaRoche has been able to maintain his solid contact abilities, but without anything resembling the power and overall hit tool he showcased as a minor leaguer. His best season, 2009 with the Pirates , saw him hit .258/.330/.401 with just 12 HRs in 590 PAs. Since then it has been considerably worse. With Chisenhall and Hannahan sitting ahead of him in Cleveland, LaRoche doesn't look like more than an emergency injury replacement, competing for a spot or playing time with Jared Goedert (who has hit much better of late than LaRoche) in Columbus.\\n\\nRobinson Tejeda RHP (1/3/12) - Working as a primary set-up man and swing starter, Tejeda was one of the Royals most valuable pitchers as recently as 2009 (posting a 1.3 fWAR in 73 innings). In 2010 he was still effective working out of the pen, but he collapsed last season. The reason is not hard to pinpoint. His average fastball velocity from 2009 to 2011 goes like this: 94.2&gt;93.7&gt;90.2. The same decline is seen in his slider and changeup, his other main offerings. Tejeda has struggled through bicep and shoulder problems the past two seasons. If Tejeda can show that he is healthy, and if his velocity returns, he seems one of the more likely candidates to appear in Cleveland. Even aside from those \\\"ifs,\\\" Tejeda has always struggled with his control (5.0 BB/9 in the majors), an issue that his limited his effectiveness throughout his career.\\n\\nChris Seddon LHP (1/9/12) - A slow-tossing lefty, Seddon has been used almost exclusively as a starter in the minors, while 17 of his 21 major league appearances have come out of the pen. Seddon's biggest asset seems to be that he has been fairly durable, and would therefore look like backup rotation depth for Columbus. Unless the Indians' scouts see some potential in his repertoire that hasn't been seen by the three previous organizations Seddon has played for, hard to see him making any impact in Cleveland.\\n\\nChin-Lung Hu SS (1/9/12) - One of the least mentioned NRIs as far as I can tell, Hu had a great season at AA and AAA in the Dodgers ' system back in 2007 (.325/.364/.507 while playing SS) that made him BA's #55 prospect in baseball. He has never been able to replicate that performance since, and was moved from the Dodgers to the Mets before last season. Since 2007 he has accumulated more than 100 games in the majors, but maxed out at 65 games with 129 PAs in 2008. Depending on whether the Indians start Juan Diaz in Akron or Columbus, Hu could end up as a starter at SS for the Clippers. He would still likely be a few notches down the pecking order in the event of a major league injury at the position, but one could imagine the circumstances that might bring him to Cleveland for a stint.\\n\\nChris Ray RHP (1/12/12) - Ray saved 33 games for the 2006 Baltimore Orioles , despite an unremarkable performance, which is apparently all you need to stick around the majors for awhile. Since then he has played for four organizations (Baltimore, Texas, San Francisco and Seattle) but has only been effective in short stints, seemingly getting by on guile as much as raw ability, as he has modest to poor strikeout abilities and mediocre control. He hasn't shown any basic decline in his pitches, so it is certainly possible he could work his smoke and mirrors in Cleveland.\\n\\nWilly Lebron RHP (1/13/12) - Lebron is old(ish), turning 33 in late March. He has very little professional track record, having been completely out of pro-ball in the US from 2007-2010. But last season Lebron showed up in the KC system and put up decent strikeout numbers in AA and AAA. This is a pure scouting sign it would seem, so hard to guess what role he might play.\\n\\nJeremy Accardo RHP (1/19/12) - Inspried by Chris Ray's 2006 season, Accardo took over the role of \\\"ineffective, but someone has to get those saves\\\" closer-role for Toronto in 2007, saving 30 games, despite a lackluster 7.6 K/9. His numbers have gotten worse since, including a nearly 3mph dip in his fastball velocity over that span, but he has remained intermittently employed. I don't see much here, but this is another one for the pitching staff and trainers to try and sort out.\\n\\nFred Lewis OF (1/19/12) - Lewis is one of the more familiar names here, having logged more than 1500 plate appearances in the majors over the past four seasons (mostly with San Francisco and Toronto). He struggled badly with Cincinnati last season, is now over 30, and is yet another left-handed hitter, seemingly limiting his potential with Cleveland. His best season came in 2008 when he hit .282/.351/.440 with the Giants . At his best, Lewis offers decent speed and hitting abilities. The best guess, however, is that his best is a few years past him.\\n\\nGregorio Petit 2B/SS (1/20/12) - Petit missed all of last season to injury, and has only seen limited playing time at the major league level in 2008 and 2009 in Oakland. As a well-regarded middle-infield glove, with very little hitting ability, Petit is likely a utility guy for Columbus. Could be the best defensive fill-in if an emergency replacement was needed in Cleveland, but offers nothing in the way of upside.\\n\\nRyan Spilborghs OF (1/20/12) - As a partial platoon guy for the Rockies , Spilborghs, a right-hander, showed a particular knack for knocking around LHP for Colorado back in 2007-2008 (putting up an OPS against LHP of nearly 1.000). His overall ability, including his success against lefties, has dropped off since then, leading to his eventual demotion back to AAA last season. If he could recapture the success he had earlier in his career, Spilborghs could be a very good option for an OF platoon spot against LHP. His competition for that spot includes Duncan, Aaron Cunningham and Thomas Neal .\", \"type\": \"blog\", \"thumbnail\": null}, {\"origin\": {\"id\": \"74e92d21-2c4c-5798-8d1f-63afa654fcc7\", \"name\": \"Baltimore Sun\"}, \"title\": \"Orioles make Betemit signing official, designate VandenHurk for assignment\", \"url\": \"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/baltimoresun/sports/baseball/rss2/~3/MVCtmM8Fq4Y/bal-orioles-make-betemit-signing-official-designate-vandenhurk-for-assignment-20120124,0,7498700.story\", \"author\": \"By Eduardo A.

It just doesn't make sense to bring in a player who made his debut a year before Brett Lawrie was even born (hat tip to @ecb282 ). But these aren't just any ordinary circumstances, this isn't your ordinary team, and this certainly isn't your run of the mill General Manager. So I guess when you can't bring back Johnny Mac, you sign his mentor instead. Omar Vizquel is the latest infielder who will get an invite to Spring training in just under a month and will compete for one of the coveted roster spots. In a vacuum, signing Omar Vizquel does not fit into the plan for this team whatsoever. However, there are other factors at play here ... factors that perhaps are being overlooked. Yes, I'm talking of course about the dreaded intangibles. It's not something that you'll find on Baseball Reference or FanGraphs, but ask any coach and I'm sure they'll tell you it's a quality that might be just as important as those cold hard statistics: veteran presence, and more importantly ... experience. If it's not on paper and if it's not trackable, some folks will immediately dismiss its value. If it's not quantifiable or measurable, then how can you determine its importance? With the&nbsp;shift towards the&nbsp;Saber movement, are intangibles like veteran presence being overlooked? Perhaps Alex Anthopoulos and John Farrell truly see the value of bringing in a 44-year old Omar Vizquel, somebody&nbsp;who's old enough to pass as his teammate's fathers. There has to be some value in that, otherwise why would&nbsp;the Blue Jays&nbsp;offer an invite to Omar Vizquel? It's not for his bat, it might partically be for his glove, but mostly I think it's to use Omar Vizquel almost as another member of the coaching staff. Except&nbsp;he doesn't wear a windbreaker in the dugout. In attempting to determine Vizquel's role on this team, some speculated that he might be the&nbsp;perfect mentor&nbsp;to the young Adeiny Hechavarria. It&nbsp;makes perfect sense; he's a work in progress, and I'm sure&nbsp;Omar is a fountain of knowledge and Adeiny would try&nbsp;to soak up as much information as possible. Then I remembered a piece on Sportsnet from last year on Chris Woodward. He served as a mentor to the young and developing players in Las Vegas, which shows the organization is definitely interested in \\\"clubhouse guys\\\" and father-like figures for their young impressionable players. Toronto's minor league affiliates are blessed to have a bevvy of very talented coaches and training staff members. But if I'm a player, I'd probably retain more information from somebody who's in the trenches every day than somebody who's coaching on the bench. Me personally, I'm more likely to listen and look up to a cooler older brother who listened to Motley Crue and drove a Mustang than my old man who drove a Taurus and listened to Hall &amp; Oates. And I think that's partially why the Blue Jays recently signed veterans like Darren Oliver and Omar Vizquel. They're both talented players, but they also have a lot to offer in the way of experience and knowledge. People&nbsp;might scoff at that notion, but I think that's partially why players like Oliver and Vizquel continue to play the game well into their 40's. It's not just because they can still pull it off, it's because they are teeming with valuable&nbsp;intangibles ... ones that can't be found in the box score. If Omar Vizquel can mentor Adeiny Hechavarria and Yunel Escobar and help them become that much better , then his contract will be worth its weight in gold.\", \"type\": \"blog\", \"thumbnail\": \"http://dlbpdvucg3lig.cloudfront.net/2012/01/24/f/lfcf4d4ad895557fca8266420774f5988.jpg\"}, {\"origin\": {\"id\": \"9ae9fc2e-8a30-520f-8a1a-4b2f41730c65\", \"name\": \"NBC Sports\"}, \"title\": \"Rangers still looking to trade reliever Koji Uehara\", \"url\": \"http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/01/24/rangers-still-looking-to-trade-reliever-koji-uehara/\", \"author\": \"Aaron Gleeman\", \"id\": \"d753cb84-bcad-597c-badb-b20d2fafa3b1\", \"source\": {\"id\": \"b0e1d80b-182c-5d1e-b8cc-95905f3d3d93\", \"name\": \"NBC Sports - Hardball Talk\"}, \"dateline_date\": \"2012-01-24T15:15:52.000000Z\", \"summary\": \"Koji Uehara quickly fell out of favor in Texas' bullpen after coming over in a midseason trade from Baltimore and his name has been linked to various trade rumors all offseason, so not surprisingly Richard Durrett of ESPN Dallas reports that the Rangers are still shopping him.

The Nationals remain a leading contender for the free-agent first baseman, if not the outright favorite.\\n\\nRosenthal explains however that the plan to sign Prince Fielder to a long term expensive contract is not unanimous among the Nationals organization. Some would prefer to go a more cost effective route, saving the big spending for when they need to extend young players like Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper down the line.

To his credit, he has had some success in the minors: .295/.339/.379 in Low-A Lowell as a 20-year-old is by no means bad for a shortstop of that age, and his .285/.315/.357 line the same year in Double-A Portland is mostly impressive due to the fact it was his age-20 season, he barely had any professional time under his belt, and he was dealing with injuries. I'm not sure just words can describe how difficult it is to be 20 years old, in Double-A, and adapting culturally all at the same time.\\n\\nThe Red Sox threw him up to Triple-A before he had fully mastered Double-A, though, and Iglesias struggled. He hit just .235/.285/.269 over 387 plate appearances, deflating the hopes of those who thought he would be ready to take over as the team's shortstop by 2012. The fact he even hit that well is, in some weird way, a success . That kind of definition-stretching likely won't be as acceptable the second time around, though.\\n\\nHe has shown some ability with the bat, at least. Not to be a legitimate hitter or anything, but enough to succeed as a defense-first shortstop slotted ninth in an otherwise strong lineup. That's all he needs to do to make it with the Red Sox, as his glove will take care of the rest. He needs more time at Triple-A, but even his second half showed some progress: he drew nine walks over his final 37 games after picking up just 12 in his first 64, and as stated before, the Red Sox believe he is slowly figuring things out .\\n\\nHe's never going to be a great hitter, but his minor league career to this point (and youth) tell us he's not likely to be in danger of becoming the next Ordonez. He might not even be the next Adam Everett , the former Red Sox farmhand who, while not in the bottom 10 like Ordonez, had a 66 OPS+ over 3,070 career plate appearances. Iglesias will never be good with the bat, by any means, but with his glove, \\\"tolerable\\\" is certainly a possibility.\\n\\nCurrent Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine's had a distaste for Ordonez's bat back in his days as Mets ' manager:\\n\\nOrdonez has won three consecutive Gold Gloves -- and two consecutive titles in a dubious offensive category. In 1998 and '99, Ordonez had the lowest on-base average plus slugging percentage in the National League. In essence, he does not get on base much and has almost no pop.\\n\\n''I don't like to throw numbers out there, but they sure in heck can't be where they are now,'' said Mets Manager Bobby Valentine, after the Mets' 7-3 exhibition victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers at Thomas J. White Stadium today. ''That's not productive. The only number that is really acceptable is R.B.I.'s, and that has to do with men on base.''\\n\\nIf Valentine's line of reasoning is still in that realm, Iglesias will have to do better before he can make an impact in Boston. Iglesias won't be able to take advantage of hitting in front of the pitcher like Ordonez, so he'll have to be capable of producing at least replacement level production offensively. Ordonez did remain the Mets' starting shortstop throughout his time there, so it's not as if Valentine pushed him out, but he's seen this movie before, and likely won't want to rush into what he fears is its sequel.\\n\\nIglesias' glove is as good as you have heard, though, so if he can just avoid the negative offensive value of a Rey Ordonez, he'll have a productive major league career. The Mike Aviles and Nick Punto combination will give him at least one more year to figure things out in Pawtucket, and if he's not ready, both will still be around in 2013. The Red Sox don't need to rush him, even if his glove is major-league ready, and his youth and their roster construction allows them to be patient with what little bat he can develop. It's not just Valentine who is thankful for that situation.\", \"type\": \"blog\", \"thumbnail\": null}, {\"origin\": {\"id\": \"5b0fec37-9de7-5874-999e-6af6af7346e8\", \"name\": \"Delaware Online\"}, \"title\": \"Verizon posts $2B 4Q loss on pension adjustment\", \"url\": \"http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20120124/BUSINESS09/120124010/1021/rss0206\", \"author\": null, \"id\": \"b6828e83-ff83-5449-98be-f54ce29aa6b2\", \"source\": {\"id\": \"b7098656-995d-574e-a884-eb65c12ade65\", \"name\": \"Delaware Online - MLB\"}, \"dateline_date\": \"2012-01-24T14:35:00.000000Z\", \"summary\": \"Verizon paid dearly to put iPhones in the hands of subscribers in the latest quarter.\", \"type\": \"news\", \"thumbnail\": \"http://dlbpdvucg3lig.cloudfront.net/2012/01/24/b/lbd35d28ffc9550e29e3dbeb825624165.jpg\"}, {\"origin\": {\"id\": \"369b0e3d-943f-5047-8102-26c710498495\", \"name\": \"SB Nation\"}, \"title\": \"Central Rumors: Astros, White Sox, Indians\", \"url\": \"http://www.mlbdailydish.com/2012/1/24/2729623/central-rumors-astros-white-sox-indians\", \"author\": \"Marisa Ingemi\", \"id\": \"8a00aa48-4530-5ef4-9944-de25a98b55fe\", \"source\": {\"id\": \"8c03c6d0-1e6a-56e1-9099-1202c069efe3\", \"name\": \"SB Nation - MLB Daily Dish\"}, \"dateline_date\": \"2012-01-24T14:31:49.000000Z\", \"summary\": \"A couple of interesting things are going on with our central teams in the AL and NL this morning, here's a round up of everything you need to know.\", \"type\": \"blog\", \"thumbnail\": null}, {\"origin\": {\"id\": null, \"name\": null}, \"title\": \"Manipulating the DH situation\", \"url\": \"http://www.yankeeanalysts.com/2012/01/manipulating-the-dh-situation-37869\", \"author\": \"Matt Imbrogno\", \"id\": \"c51a413b-4416-5ed0-b0b4-e26d63c4ab9f\", \"source\": {\"id\": \"a0c182ae-724b-583d-b48a-2b341ed0caf7\", \"name\": \"The Yankee Analysts\"}, \"dateline_date\": \"2012-01-24T14:30:20.000000Z\", \"summary\": \"Pardon me if you're exhausted from it, but the Yankees' DH situation is about the only thing left to talk about as the Hot Stove (thankfully) enters its final stretch drive and we (finally) approach Spring Training.

What could a name change mean to the Astros ? In the negative, it would mean yet another departure from tradition, sure to alienate the hardened core of Astros fans aged twenty to ninety. In the positive, it would create a clean slate, a new era, and the opportunity to establish new traditions in a new league, shedding the stigma that has dogged the franchise for years.\\n\\nEverybody is rightfully debating the pros and cons (though to be honest, I haven't heard very many people 'pro-ing' on the subject), but nobody is asking the important question:\\n\\nWhat will the new name be?\\n\\nThankfully, the recently-fire-hardened Astros fanbase has The Crawfish Boxes to turn to for answers. Below are the options that the Astros' Marketing Department may or may not be definitely considering for absolutely possibly changing the Astros' name.\\n\\nThe Houston Traffic :\\n\\nThe Astros' new name must be something that is clearly affiliated with the city of Houston. It must be something that brings the paying customers together - makes them feel as if their ball team understands them, identifies with them, and feels their pain. Thus, one option is to re-name the Astros to the Traffic . This has the bonus that Jim Crane and company will be able to charge licensing fees to every T.V. and Radio Station who announces, \\\"And now let's turn to Layne Boulevard for the Houston Traffic Report\\\" every quarter-hour.\\n\\nThe Houston Rebels :\\n\\nAs much as it would disgust me to have my favorite ball club named after a rival SEC school, there are advantages to the name Rebels. It would help the fabricated rivalry between our friends in Arlington, as \\\"Rebels and Rangers \\\" has the same kind of ring as \\\"Cowboys and Indians ,\\\" or even \\\"Cowboys and Aliens.\\\" Regardless, it would also add a bit of spice to match-ups with the Yankees .\\n\\nThe Houston _________________ :\\n\\nHere's a novel concept. During the off season, hold a contest for the fans. Allow them to submit suggestions and vote for the new name and logo of the team. The winner gets season tickets and free food (but not beer! Crane has to make his money somewhere! ) and the fans have the extra spice of seeing a scenery change every season. The marketing possibilities are limitless.\\n\\nThe Houston Minute Maids :\\n\\nSpeaking of marketing possibilities, here's a name that will help the Astros pay down the debt sooner. Simply pimp the team's dignity out to the highest bidder, name the club after that company (or individual), and pay off the debt to make them competitive faster. Other clubs will be jealous, though the the players would have to put up with a bit more playground name-calling on game day. Other options along this line: The Houston Continental-Uniteds , the Houston Halliburtons , the Houston Mattress Macks , or the Houston Memorial Hermann Healthcare Systems (though this would likely end their affiliation with the Methodist Hospital system, but hey - bring in the new, right?).\\n\\nThe Houston Honey Badgers :\\n\\nActually, this one wouldn't work because lately the Astros and their fans have been required to take @#%&amp; from just about everybody. Scratch that idea.\\n\\nThe Houston National Leaguers :\\n\\nAs a form of ultimate protest against Bud Selig's Draconian rule, the Astros should change their name to the National Leaguers, refuse to utilize the DH rule by continuing to bat pitchers 9th once in the American League, and thus lead the revolution by making the other AL teams admire their pluckiness in the face of adversity. They'll say, \\\"Those Houston National Leaguers came to the AL under duress, but they sure know how to fight! Maybe they've got something there. We will eliminate the DH for our club too!\\\" And the other 14 teams will eventually fall in line, completely undoing the concept of the Designated Hitter, thus sending Selig packing to his retirement with his dreams crushed.\\n\\nThe Houston Crawfish :\\n\\nThis as a nod to the best Houston blog site on the internet. Call me a suck-up, but you know that'd be awesome.\\n\\nBelow, please vote for your favorite suggestion. If you have other name ideas that I have not listed here, post them in the comments, and if I am jealous that you though of them and I didn't, I will update the article with your suggestions, giving you full credit and at least fifteen characters of fame.\\n\\nPoll\\n\\nVote!!\\n\\nHouston Traffic\\n\\nHouston Rebels\\n\\nHouston ______________\\n\\nHouston Minute Maids (or other highest bidder)\\n\\nHouston National Leaguers\\n\\nHouston Crawfish\\n\\n&nbsp; 51 votes | Results\", \"type\": \"blog\", \"thumbnail\": null}, {\"origin\": {\"id\": \"2ee10f73-e797-5823-a132-5ff4c38d0052\", \"name\": \"SNY\"}, \"title\": \"Mets and Chris Young Rumors\", \"url\": \"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/metsblogfeed/~3/TT23X1lPIfQ/\", \"author\": \"Matthew Cerrone\", \"id\": \"0ee9da78-7532-5944-86b4-f2b76aa27eea\", \"source\": {\"id\": \"cca23aef-069f-5e5d-9bb1-cbf687d47ae1\", \"name\": \"SNY - Mets Blog\"}, \"dateline_date\": \"2012-01-24T14:26:00.000000Z\", \"summary\": \"Yesterday on Twitter, ESPN.com's Jerry Crasnick said: Last month on a conference call with reporters, Alderson said he\\u00a0had recently met with Young\\u00a0in San Diego, adding, \\\"He's the kind of guy we might re-sign under the right circumstances.\\\" Young talked to ...

Change the name? Why, they'd stop being fans!\\n\\nWell.\\n\\nIf the Astros do wind up changing their nickname, it wouldn't be the first time they've done so. When the franchise began in 1962, they were known as the Colt .45s -- try to imagine a team nicknamed after a gun in present-day professional sports. The NBA's Washington Bullets were re-nicknamed the Wizards in 1997; our SB Nation Wizards site, \\\"Bullets Forever\\\" , pays homage to the previous name.\\n\\nYou might think team nicknames are immutable and forever. You've always been a Yankees fan, right? Or cheered for the Phillies , or the Dodgers or the Braves? All those teams have been around for a century or more ... but they haven't always been known by those names.\\n\\nIn the early days of baseball, while teams did have nicknames, they weren't considered trademarks as they are today. Two franchises -- the Cubs and Braves -- have been in continuous operation since 1876. The team now known as the Cubs was originally known as the \\\"White Stockings\\\". But as often as not, they were simply called \\\"the Chicagos\\\". Over time, they were also called \\\"Orphans\\\" (when many of their longtime players departed) or \\\"Colts\\\" (when they got younger replacements), before a newspaper headline writer, looking for a shorter name for a young team, came up with \\\"Cubs\\\". It stuck, and became the team's official nickname in 1907.\\n\\nOther teams have similar stories. The Dodgers, during their time in Brooklyn, were known at various times as Atlantics, Grays, Grooms, Bridegrooms, Superbas and Robins ; they didn't settle for \\\"Dodgers\\\" officially until 1932. The team now known as the Atlanta Braves was, while in Boston, called Red Stockings, Beaneaters, Doves and Rustlers ; they became \\\"Braves\\\" permanently in 1912 -- but then, after a low period in their history, renamed themselves \\\"Bees\\\" from 1936-1940. It didn't help; after five mediocre-to-bad years they went back to Braves.\\n\\nThe Phillies, for some of the same reasons, renamed themselves \\\" Blue Jays \\\", though somewhat unofficially, in 1943 and 1944 after an ownership change before returning to their original moniker.\\n\\nDuring the Red Scare of the 1950s, the Cincinnati Reds decided that having a name that headline writers were using to describe Communists wouldn't do, and from 1954-1959 were known as the \\\"Redlegs\\\".\\n\\nAnd just four years ago, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays changed their color scheme and logo; instead of an aquatic creature, they were now a \\\"Ray\\\" of sunshine, as noted on their uniforms. This happened to coincide with the franchise's sudden leap into playoff contention, so most of their fans are likely happy with it.\\n\\nAll of this is to say that Astros fans shouldn't be so sure that their nickname will remain in perpetuity. The franchise has changed logos and uniform colors at least six times since they moved into the then-futuristic Astrodome and adopted the name \\\"Astros\\\" in 1965. With the move to the American League in 2013, why not make a break with the past and rename the club?\\n\\nIn the comments to Rob's feature, several people made suggestions for new nicknames, some more tongue-in-cheek than others. I've incorporated some of those ideas in the poll below, and added one suggestion of my own: Buffaloes. That was the nickname of a minor-league club that played in Houston in various incarnations from 1888 until Houston was granted a major league franchise in 1962. Often abbreviated to \\\"Buffs\\\", the name has historic significance. If Jim Crane wants to change the team name while giving a nod to the city's baseball history and yet looking forward, this could be a very good choice.\\n\\nPoll\\n\\nWhat nickname should the Houston Astros take when they move to the AL in 2013?\\n\\nAstros! Keep the Astros!\\n\\nBuffaloes\\n\\nColts (not Colt .45s, just Colts)\\n\\nCranes\\n\\nCrawfish\\n\\nEagles\\n\\nGenerals\\n\\nOilers\\n\\nTexans\\n\\nWolfpack\\n\\nSomething else (leave in comments)\\n\\n&nbsp; 54 votes | Results\", \"type\": \"blog\", \"thumbnail\": null}, {\"origin\": {\"id\": \"34d30cd0-bd29-5320-b0db-b68476d84db3\", \"name\": \"Rogers Sportsnet\"}, \"title\": \"Fan Fuel: Is Brandon Morrow worth $20 million?\", \"url\": \"http://www.sportsnet.ca/fanfuel/2012/01/24/morrow_contract/\", \"author\": null, \"id\": \"6a3471fe-1ea8-52a1-bb5d-f24e992f5eac\", \"source\": {\"id\": \"97679478-d8ba-5922-9b5d-c59b589eec9a\", \"name\": \"Rogers Sportsnet - All Blogs\"}, \"dateline_date\": \"2012-01-24T14:25:00.000000Z\", \"summary\": \"Fan Fuel's Rob MacNeil wonders if Brandon Morrow is worth a $20 million commitment from the Blue Jays?\", \"type\": \"blog\", \"thumbnail\": \"http://dlbpdvucg3lig.cloudfront.net/2012/01/24/d/lddedbe3b17ea56238a85ad55287a53f5.jpg\"}, {\"origin\": {\"id\": \"13a37739-7650-5d18-87ae-e8cfe152bbbd\", \"name\": \"MLB.com\"}, \"title\": \"Bids due as auctioning of Dodgers begins\", \"url\": \"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120123&content_id=26436580&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb&partnerId=rss_mlb\", \"author\": \"Ken Gurnick\", \"id\": \"6ee3f8df-3afa-5829-8238-111ed50a5d98\", \"source\": {\"id\": \"6f5b1f44-2c30-548e-aabd-e7856ec3e818\", \"name\": \"MLB.com - Anthony Castrovince\"}, \"dateline_date\": \"2012-01-24T14:23:00.000000Z\", \"summary\": \"Bids due as auctioning of Dodgers begins\", \"type\": \"columnists\", \"thumbnail\": null}, {\"origin\": {\"id\": \"9ae9fc2e-8a30-520f-8a1a-4b2f41730c65\", \"name\": \"NBC Sports\"}, \"title\": \"Great Moments in Photoshop: Albert Pujols playing first base for the Angels ... now!\", \"url\": \"http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/01/24/great-moments-in-photoshop-albert-pujols-playing-first-base-for-the-angels-now/\", \"author\": \"Craig Calcaterra\", \"id\": \"83d282cd-5f29-54cd-a11e-f5264c0a875d\", \"source\": {\"id\": \"b0e1d80b-182c-5d1e-b8cc-95905f3d3d93\", \"name\": \"NBC Sports - Hardball Talk\"}, \"dateline_date\": \"2012-01-24T14:21:45.000000Z\", \"summary\": \"Derrick Goold got a hold of the 2012 Topps Albert Pujols card. \\u00a0Which features him playing first base in a game situation. \\u00a0For the Angels. \\u00a0Which is awesome because he hasn't, you know, done that yet.

He pitched well in his first few years as a starter in A ball before undergoing Tommy John surgery midway through the 2005 season and missing all of 2006. He returned in 2007, working as a swingman for AA Wichita, earning a 3.08 ERA and a 1.32 WHIP in 108 innings, then built on that success in 2008 with a 2.91 ERA and a 1.20 ERA in 52 innings for AA Northwest Arkansas, before struggling in AAA with a 5.04 ERA and a 1.63 WHIP for Omaha. He was much better in a return to Omaha in 2009, posting a 3.50 ERA and a 1.37 WHIP in 87.1 innings, numbers good enough to earn him a September call up. He pitched in 8 games, including his lone Major League start, putting up a 5.14 ERA, a 1.50 WHIP, and 15 strikeouts in 14 innings.\\n\\nHe earned a job in Kansas City's bullpen in 2010, and spent the entire season in the Majors, appearing in 57 games, finishing 19, and putting up a 3.83 ERA and a 1.47 WHIP. Despite that solid rookie season, the Royals put him on waivers and the Twins claimed him prior to the 2011 season. He earned a job in Minnesota's bullpen to start the 2011 season, but after putting up a 9.95 ERA and a 2.13 WHIP in 12.2 innings over 15 appearances, he was optioned to AAA Rochester, where he spent the rest of the season, earning a 4.29 ERA, a 1.39 WHIP, and 10.8 K/9 in 56.2 innings over 43 appearances. After the season he became a Minor League free agent and signed with the Braves in late November.\\n\\nHughes is a bit of an undersized lefty, listed at a generous 5'10\\\", 185 pounds, and he has only an average fastball, sitting between 88 and 91, though he pairs it with a well above average changeup that comes in between 80 and 83, a difference in speed and movement that baffles hitters when he's on. His diving slider is a solid pitch when it's on, and he's better when it is, and his curveball is a loopy show-me pitch.\\n\\nThere are a few open spots in the Braves bullpen, so with an outstanding Spring Training Hughes could find himself on an opening day roster for the third straight year. Atlanta already has the best pair of lefty relievers in the game in Jonny Venters and Eric O'Flaherty, so in addition to competing with pitchers like Anthony Varvaro , Arodys Vizcaino , Cory Gearrin , Jairo Asencio , JJ Hoover, Adam Russell , Todd Redmond , Jaye Chapman , and fellow lefty Robert Fish for one of the final bullpen spots, Hughes may have to contend with the team being content with only having two lefties in the pen. At worst, Hughes will provide a veteran presence in AAA Gwinnett's bullpen while waiting for an opportunity to open up in Atlanta.\", \"type\": \"blog\", \"thumbnail\": null}, {\"origin\": {\"id\": \"3941813f-12df-5b39-b3ad-e2decda7030d\", \"name\": \"YES\"}, \"title\": \"Jesus Montero And Maturity\", \"url\": \"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/RiverAveBlues/~3/xuZn7jGoqVc/\", \"author\": \"Mike Axisa\", \"id\": \"75e53912-158f-531b-ae24-78ca5be6853b\", \"source\": {\"id\": \"ca8897ab-865e-581b-b058-ed73b7a0cb09\", \"name\": \"YES - River Ave. Blues\"}, \"dateline_date\": \"2012-01-24T14:00:44.000000Z\", \"summary\": \"Ten days after the agreement was reported, the trade sending Jesus Montero and Hector Noesi to the Mariners in exchange for Michael Pineda and Jose Campos was made official yesterday.

Here is my top-10 list for 2012, with a few omissions and sleepers at the end.\\n\\n1. Julio Teheran - RHP - Age: 21\\n\\nTeheran has all the tools to become an ace in the Major Leagues. He dominated the competition in Triple-A last season and experienced some growing pains while making a handful of starts in Atlanta. He features a hard fastball with movement and solid changeup, and while his breaking ball lacks polish and needs to sharpen a bit, it still rates as average.\\n\\nHe will begin the 2012 season in either Atlanta or Gwinnett depending on the health of Tim Hudson , Tommy Hanson and/or Jair Jurrjens .\\n\\n2. Randall Delgado - RHP - Age: 22\\n\\nDelgado projects to be a front-end starter in the Major Leagues and could see plenty of time in the Major Leagues in 2012 after getting a cup of coffee with the Braves in 2011. Armed with a solid fastball, slider and changeup, Delgado will likely need some more time pitching at Gwinnett to refine his mechanics, but he has the potential to be a stalwart in Atlanta for years to come.\\n\\n3. Arodys Vizcaino - RHP - Age: 21\\n\\nVizcaino finally stayed healthy in 2011 and rocketed from High-A ball to the Major Leagues in August. When he was acquired from the Yankees in 2009 most felt he projected as a front-end starter, but the Braves appear to be grooming him as a late-inning reliever for the near future. His fastball-curveball combination is as good as any in baseball, although he lacks a third pitch, which is likely the reason for the move to the bullpen.\\n\\nHe will likely begin the season in Atlanta or Gwinnett, depending on his performance in Spring Training.\\n\\n4. Andrelton Simmons - Shortstop - Age: 22\\n\\nSimmons is a very intriguing prospect who could move into the top-50 for all of baseball with a big year in 2012. He features a rocket arm that will draw comparisons to Rafael Furcal and Yunel Escobar and has solid range at shortstop. Simmons is very lean and will not hit for much power, although he could steal 30+ bases at the next level. Because of the small frame, it is very unlikely he ever develops much power.\\n\\nSimmons will spend the 2012 season at Double-A Mississippi and all eyes will be on the shortstop as he makes the most difficult jump of his career. Should he perform well, a promotion to Atlanta could be in the cards as early as 2013.\\n\\n5. Edward Salcedo - 3rd Base - Age: 20\\n\\nSalcedo signed with the Braves and was widely regarded as the best international free agent to ever sign with the club. He played his first full season in 2011 and struggled both at the plate and in the field, although he showed flashes of brilliance that had scouts drooling over the athletic third baseman. His power numbers are already in place, although many would like to see him improve his plate discipline and contact ratings in 2012.\\n\\nDefense is also a concern. Salcedo, who began as a shortstop before switching over to the hot corner, committed 40 errors last year, although quite a few of them can probably be attributed to poor playing conditions and official rulings. Should he improve in the field this season, his value will increase tremendously, even if his development at the plate is not what some would like to see.\\n\\nSalcedo will likely play the year year at High-A Lynchburg.\\n\\n6. Sean Gilmartin - LHP - Age: 21\\n\\nGilmartin was the first round pick of the Braves this past summer after a successful tenure at Florida State. He has been compared to Mike Minor for obvious reasons; a southpaw, he does not posses electric 'stuff', although he is capable of getting outs and knows what he wants to do on the mound. His fastball will sit in the low-90s and mixes in a solid changeup and curveball. At best, he's a No. 3 starter in the Majors for a long time. At worst, he's a decent No. 5 starter.\\n\\nGilmartin will likely take a similar path to Atlanta as Minor did, beginning the season at Double-A Mississippi and then moving up to Gwinnett if he performs well.\\n\\n7. Christian Bethancourt - Catcher - Age: 20\\n\\nSome folks are in love with Bethancourt, who could certainly become an All-Star catcher one day, but I'm just not sold. While he already possesses a rocket arm behind the plate and continually makes solid contact at the plate, he has a long, long way to go both offensively and defensively to make it.\\n\\nBetween A, A+ and the Arizona Fall League in 2011, Bethancourt hit .287/302/.426, which isn't horrible for a catcher his age. What is concerning is his BB% of 2.6% and poor approach at the plate, along with his .330 BABIP which is bound to come down some as he reaches the higher levels of the Minor Leagues.\\n\\n2012 will be a huge year for Bethancourt. Similar to Salcedo, it could be his make-or-break season. That is not to say that a poor campaign would derail his chance at a successful career with the Braves, but many in the industry may stop looking at him as a top-tier catching prospect. He will likely spend the year at High-A Lynchburg.\\n\\n8. Tyler Pastornicky - Shortstop - Age: 21\\n\\nPastornicky will likely be the Opening Day shortstop for the Braves, which is concerning to many, myself included. This being said, there is plenty to like about Pastornicky, mostly because he does not have a glaring weakness to his game. He probably won't ever hit for much power, but he had solid numbers throughout all levels of the Minors, including a remarkable run at Gwinnett to end the season.\\n\\nDefensively he will be a downgrade from Alex Gonzalez, but his improved hitting should make up for it. Most scouts view Pastornicky as slightly above average in terms of range and throwing ability. Best case scenario is he holds his own at the plate and in the field. Worst case scenario is he manages to get through the 2012 season and then turns into a very valuable utility infielder off the bench.\\n\\n9. Joey Terdoslavich - Third Base, Outfield - Age: 23\\n\\nJ-Terd is an interesting guy. After a pretty average debut season as a professional in 2010, he had arguably the best offensive season of any player in the farm system. While he was one of the older players in High-A ball, Terdoslavich hit .286, belted 20 homers, had an OPS of .867 and posted respectable walk and strikeout ratios. He mainly played left field, where he was view as mediocre defensively.\\n\\nWhat makes J-Terd so intriguing is he will play third base in 2012, a position the Braves desperately need to stockpile with Chipper Jones likely done in a year or two, and he will make the transition while making the biggest jump of his career to Double-A Mississippi.\\n\\nNo one should realistically expect him to duplicate his strong numbers from 2011, but if he can hold his own defensively at the hot corner and continue to hit well in the meantime he would immediately become the best hitting prospect in the organization. If he hits well but struggles in the field, he will likely move back to left field, which would diminish his value quite a bit.\\n\\n10. J.R. Graham - RHP - Age: 21\\n\\nGraham was a fourth round pick for the Braves last summer and probably has the most electric stuff of anyone in the organization outside of Atlanta. Similar to Craig Kimbrel , his fastball-slider combination is lethal and he has been clocked in the high-90's by various scouts. He still lacks a third pitch to continue his development as a starting pitcher, but he always has the potential to be a back-end reliever should that development never take place.\\n\\nHe dominated the competition in a short stint at Rookie Ball and will likely begin the year in High-A Lynchburg. Should he continue to improve and show scouts why some had him projected for the second round of the draft, he could see Atlanta by mid-2013.\\n\\nJust missed the cut: J.J. Hoover , Zeke Spruill; I'm a fan of both pitchers, but Hoover is likely headed for the bullpen as a middle reliever and Spruill doesn't have nearly as high of an upside as others on this list. Both will likely spend quite some time in the Major Leagues, but I don't expect anything special from either.\\n\\nBreakout Candidates: Brandon Drury, Tommy La Stella, Todd Cunningham , Carlos Perez, Navery Moore.\\n\\nFor more on the Braves, head on over to Talking Chop .\\n\\nFollow me on Twitter: Follow @scottcoleman55\", \"type\": \"blog\", \"thumbnail\": null}, {\"origin\": {\"id\": null, \"name\": null}, \"title\": \"Why Did Front Office Give Up On F-Mart?\", \"url\": \"http://metsmerizedonline.com/2012/01/why-did-front-office-give-up-on-f-mart.html\", \"author\": \"Joe D\", \"id\": \"73ec23a9-3755-5411-a2f3-42b16749e94e\", \"source\": {\"id\": \"a4d50be7-d791-5f47-b298-3037e30e68e2\", \"name\": \"Mets Merized\"}, \"dateline_date\": \"2012-01-24T14:00:03.000000Z\", \"summary\": \"Anthony DiComo of Mets.com tackled a question on the recently waived Fernando Martinez in his mailbag feature today.

The complete list:\\n\\nWar Horse The Artist Moneyball The Descendants The Tree of Life Midnight in Paris The Help Hugo Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close\\n\\nWith the exception of Incredibly Loud &amp; Extremely Close and arguably War Horse , none of those nominees constitute surprises. The favorites in this category are The Artist -- a mostly silent film set in Hollywood in the 1920s, and co-starring a really bright Jack Russell Terrier -- and The Descendants , starring George Clooney.*\\n\\n* I've seen seven of the nine nominated films, the exceptions being Awfully Close &amp; Terribly Loud ; and The Help -- and enjoyed all seven. Forced to rank them, I would go The Artist , The Descendants , The Tree of Life , Moneyball , Hugo , Midnight in Paris , War Horse . In my opinion, the first three of those films have the virtue of being essentially flawless, though The Tree of Life certainly isn't for everyone. For me, the two missing movies are Contagion -- directed by Stephen Soderbergh, who was supposed to direct Moneyball but didn't -- and Martha Marcy May Marlene , which I found similar in tone and quality to Winter's Bone , which did receive a nomination a year ago.\\n\\nOkay, raise your hand if, five years ago, you thought Jonah Hill would get nominated for Academy Award before he turned 30...\\n\\nNo one?\\n\\nYeah, me neither. But his performance in Moneyball is one of the best things in the movie, both funny and nuanced. I thought he was actually better as the title character in 2010's Cyrus , but nobody asked me. Anyway, he's exceptionally unlikely to win, as 82-year-old Christopher Plummer looks like the big favorite for his performance in Beginners .\\n\\nRob Neyer: Live-blogging Moneyball\\n\\nAnd then there's Brad Pitt, whose portrayal of Billy Beane garnered a Best Actor nomination. Moneyball , for all its other charms , rises and falls on Beane's character and Pitt absolutely nailed it.\\n\\nPitt's competition in this category?

Cole Hamels had just the 14 victories, so even though he was the fourth-most valuable NL starter, I actually had the tier right. Pitchers just aren't that great individually for fantasy.

His peripherals are fine, but more in line with the rest of this group, not those of an ace. Kuroda missed out on a three-star ranking in 2011, but a move to NY might get him there, depending on how the new park treats him.\\n\\nZack Greinke's missed time was going to keep him from four-star status, but his 3.83 ERA a far cry from the 2.98 FIP his peripherals suggested -- guaranteed he wouldn't hit his projected value.

I'm sure I'm not the only one. Edwin Jackson looked like he had turned a corner when he joined the White Sox , but as he so often does, he then remembered he is nothing if not inconsistent. Jackson is another pitcher I won't take unless my back is against the wall, despite knowing his bright moments are luminous indeed. Jon Niese once again fell short in terms of innings, and also took a BABIP beating for the second year in a row. I'm starting to wonder if he's going to turn out to be a frustrating, Ricky Nolasco-esque starter.\\n\\nJorge de la Rosa wasn't expected to do much as a Colorado starter, and a shortened season made sure that happened.

And yes, I'm aware that I'm ignoring how homers affect batting average, but that's OK in my book. The long and the short of it is that elite power hitters are rare, and you need to pay to get them.

Averaging over the whole sample presented here results in a composite pitcher very similar to what Furbush did last year across Detroit and Seattle. For those pitchers, they averaged a little under 2 WAR over the standard 160-inning season. In other words, pretty close to average.\\n\\nThat's not much of a surprise if you looked solely at the three big rates; strikeout, walk and ground ball. Furbush's combined 18% strikeouts, 9% walk (and HBP) and 42% ground balls are nearly spot on league average. Weighting that Furbush faced about 75% of his batters from the rotation, a Major League average slate of those three rates would be, 18%, 9% and 43%. I said it was close! Almost as close as the Costa Concordia came to those rocks.\\n\\nOn a side note, Hector Noesi's Major League numbers last year were quite similar to Furbush's, aside from the home run problem. Noesi ended 2011 with an 18% strikeout rate, 8% walk rate and 42% ground ball rate, though much more in relief than Furbush.

The switch-hitting Didier didn't hit much--in fact, he never hit a home run in his six-year big league career--but he was an excellent fielder and a strong thrower. In 1969, he finished fourth in the National League Rookie of the Year race, as he helped the Braves to the first ever National League West title.\\n\\nDidier might have had a career along the lines of defender extraordinaire Jim Sundberg , but injuries derailed him. Back problems, In particular prevented Didier from becoming an everyday player. After his rookie season of 1969, he never played in more than 57 games in a season, and by 1974, his major league career was over.\\n\\nOf the few Topps cards that portrayed Didier, his 1973 Topps is by far the most interesting. This rough-and-tumble action shot shows him trying to apply a tag to Mets outfielder Cleon Jones (wearing No. 21), who is sliding hard into home plate as one of the Mets' catchers (either Jerry Grote or Duffy Dyer ) looks on from the background. Didier seems confident that he has tagged Jones out in time, but is still awaiting the call from the home plate umpire. So is Jones, the Mets' fleet footed starting left fielder, out or safe?\\n\\nThe Didier card raises another interesting question. Normally, Topps cards portray scenes from the previous season, so we would assume that this picture was snapped in 1972. But there's a problem. Didier is not wearing the Braves' blue-and-white road uniform that was adopted in 1972. Instead, he is wearing the road gray, which was last used by the Braves in 1971.\\n\\nA check of Didier's 1972 playing log confirms our suspicions. Didier played in only 13 games in '72, and none against the Mets. So it is likely that the Didier/Jones play took place sometime in 1971.\\n\\nSo we know it's Shea Stadium, likely in 1971.

Kennedy's noteworthiness has little to do with the fact he shares a name with the then-US Senator from Massachusetts. No, this Kennedy has something much more notable to contribute to baseball history.\\n\\nYou see, in a very real sense Kennedy's entrance marked a new chapter in the history of the Philadelphia Phillies. In one key way he was unlike any previous player in the history of the Phillies.\\n\\nJohn Kennedy was black.\\n\\nBy entering the game, he became the first black to ever play for the Phillies. Ten years after Jackie Robinson integrated all of baseball (and several months after he played his last game), the Phillies became the last NL team to integrate their roster.\\n\\nThat didn't mean all baseball had integrated. Over in the AL the Tigers and Red Sox still fielded all-white lineups, but the senior circuit's integration was now complete.\\n\\nThe NL had always been at the forefront of integration. The Dodgers, Giants, and Braves had been especially aggressive in integrating their teams, playing stars such as Robinson, Roy Campanella , Willie Mays , Monte Irvin , Hank Aaron , and others. Not so coincidentally, those teams won every NL pennant from 1951-59.\\n\\nThe other teams, though, had also uncovered some amazing talents. By 1957, Ernie Banks was already the Cubs' shortstop, Frank Robinson was an instant sensation in Cincinnati, and the Pirates had a young outfielder bursting with talent named Roberto Clemente .\\n\\nSt. Louis hadn't found a big star black player yet, but by the end of the decade they'd begin playing Curt Flood , Bill White , and Bob Gibson .\\n\\nThe Phillies were the slowest of the NL teams to move forward. Yes they did integrate with Kennedy, but he only played five games with the club. Twice he was a late game infield defensive replacement, and the other trio of appearances came as a pinch runner. Philadelphia wouldn't land their first real star African-American until Dick Allen arrived in 1964.\\n\\nI have no idea why the Phillies were so comparatively slow to integrate. Racism is one obvious answer, but it could just have been managerial incompetence. They are, after all, historically the worst franchise in history. When Jackie Robinson integrated baseball the Phillies were finishing a stretch of 31 seasons in which they had 30 losing records (and went 78-76 in the other year).\\n\\nThey were actually good in the late 1940s and early 1950, and that could've deceived them into thinking they didn't need to recruit blacks. They won the pennant in 1950 with an all-white roster \\u2013 maybe they thought they (finally) had figured out how to put a team together.\\n\\nRegardless, the last NL team did integrate \\u2013 exactly 20,000 days ago today.\\n\\nAside from that, many other baseball events celebrate their \\\"day-versary\\\" or anniversary today.
